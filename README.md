The architecture of PayMe is designed with a focus on clarity and efficiency:
- **Well-Organized Structure**: The application follows a modular approach, where each component operates independently. This separation of concerns enhances code readability and maintainability.
- **Control Flow**: The control flow is clearly defined, ensuring that data and commands are processed in an orderly manner. This organization allows for easy navigation through the application and straightforward interaction between different parts of the system.
- **Independent Functionality**: Each section of the application can be tested and modified independently, minimizing the risk of unintended effects on other components. This modular design simplifies debugging and optimization.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Developed using **ASP.NET Core**, providing a robust and scalable API that handles data management and user interactions.
- **Frontend**: Built with **React**, leveraging the power of **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability. **Material-UI (MUI)** is used to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
